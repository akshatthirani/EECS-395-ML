# EECS-395-ML

* Machine learning project for binary and multi-class object detection using computer vision techniques.

The demo is a script (src/demo.m) that runs the classifier over some randomly selected images in the src/demo folder.
Demo.m internally uses the src/demo_classifier(image) function  that can also be run independently over any image.
